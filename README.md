## üéØ Overview

An intelligent Home Assistant blueprint for HVAC control that goes beyond simple window-open detection. This blueprint focuses on energy efficiency while maintaining comfort through smart temperature management and configurable behaviors.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üå°Ô∏è **Smart Temperature Thresholds**
  - Intelligent HVAC control based on outdoor temperature
  - Configurable high/low temperature thresholds

- ‚è∞ **Time-Aware Operation**
  - Different behaviors for day and night
  - Customizable timeouts for both periods
  - Evening checks for open windows before bedtime

- üîÑ **Intelligent State Management**
  - Remembers previous HVAC modes
  - Smart restoration after window closure
  - Prevents unnecessary system cycling

- üìä **Environmental Monitoring**
  - Optional humidity monitoring
  - Atmospheric pressure tracking
  - Temperature-based decisions

- üì± **Smart Notifications**
  - Detailed status updates
  - Window location information
  - Customizable notification cooldowns

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Click the "Import Blueprint" button above
2. Configure the following required entities:
   - Climate entity (your HVAC system)
   - Window/door sensors
   - Notification device
3. Optional: Add environmental sensors
   - Temperature sensor
   - Humidity sensor
   - Pressure sensor
4. Set your preferred thresholds and timings

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Required Settings
- `climate_entity`: Your HVAC system
- `window_sensors`: Window/door sensors to monitor
- `notify_device`: Device for notifications

### Optional Settings
- `temperature_sensor`: Outdoor temperature monitoring
- `humidity_sensor`: Humidity monitoring
- `pressure_sensor`: Atmospheric pressure monitoring
- `seasonal_mode`: Summer/Winter/Auto operation modes
- `restore_climate_state`: Remember previous HVAC states

### Timing Configuration
- `daytime_hvac_timeout`: Delay before HVAC shutdown during day
- `nighttime_hvac_timeout`: Delay before HVAC shutdown at night
- `night_check_time`: Time for evening window checks
- `notification_cooldown`: Minimum time between notifications

## üîÆ Roadmap

- [ ] Indoor humidity monitoring and ventilation reminders
- [ ] Weather forecast integration for rain warnings
- [ ] Advanced door security checks for night time
- [ ] Extended seasonal operation modes
- [ ] Smart home system integrations
- [ ] Multi-zone HVAC support
- [ ] Energy consumption analytics
- [ ] Custom notification templates
